GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software.

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
By contrast, the GPL is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender them.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change software.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
The GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.
     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.
     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

  1. Source Code.
     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form for making modifications.

  2. Basic Permissions.
     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program,
     and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
     You may convey a work based on the Program under section 4, provided that you also meet all conditions:
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it.
     b) You must license the entire work under this License.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
     You may convey a covered work in object code form under sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey
     the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License.

  7. Additional Terms.
     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions.

  8. Termination.
     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors.

 11. Patents.
     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
     If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
     You have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.
     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

 16. Limitation of Liability.
     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public,
the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program:
